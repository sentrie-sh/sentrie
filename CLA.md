# Sentrie Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Sentrie**.  
This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) ensures that contributions to the project remain legally clear, reusable, and maintainable over the long term.

This document describes the rights that you grant when you submit contributions to the project, and the obligations you confirm you follow.  
It applies to all contributions you make to this repository **under the GitHub account you use to submit them**.

This CLA does **not** transfer ownership of your code.  
You retain all copyright over your contributions.

## 1. Definitions

**“You”** (or **“Contributor”**) means the individual GitHub account identified in a pull request or commit.

**“Contribution”** means any code, documentation, content, or other material intentionally submitted to the Sentrie project.

**“Project”** means the Sentrie open-source codebase and associated documentation stored in this repository.

## 2. Grant of Rights

For every Contribution you submit, you grant the Project the following rights, on a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free basis:

1. The right to **use**, **modify**, **reproduce**, **display**, **perform**, and **distribute** your Contribution as part of the Project.
2. The right to **sublicense** your Contribution under any license(s) the Project uses.
3. The right to **prepare derivative works** of your Contribution.

These rights allow the Project to incorporate your work into the codebase, redistribute binaries, publish documentation, and maintain the software long-term.

You may continue to use, license, or distribute your own work in any way you choose.

If you own or control any patent claims that would be infringed by your Contribution or by combining your Contribution with the Project:
